## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Fraud Detection
```ruby
fraud_check = FraudDetectionService.new(
  user, order, :order_placement,
  { ip_address: '192.168.1.1', amount: 10000 }
).check

fraud_check.risk_score # => 45
fraud_check.high_risk? # => false
```

### Trust Scoring
```ruby
trust_score = TrustScore.calculate_for(user)
trust_score.score # => 75
trust_score.trust_level # => "trusted"
trust_score.badge # => { name: "Trusted", icon: "⭐⭐" }
```

### Behavioral Analysis
```ruby
patterns = BehavioralPatternDetector.new(user).detect_all
anomalous = patterns.select(&:anomalous?)
```

### Device Fingerprinting
```ruby
fingerprint = DeviceFingerprint.find_or_create_by!(
  fingerprint_hash: device_hash
)
fingerprint.calculate_risk_score # => 35
```
