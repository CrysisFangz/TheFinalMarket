# ðŸš€ ENTERPRISE-GRADE AUTHORIZATION ABILITY
# Sophisticated role-based access control with granular permissions
#
# This class implements transcendent authorization capabilities for RailsAdmin
# and the entire application ecosystem, leveraging CanCanCan's declarative DSL
# to enforce zero-trust security policies across all models and actions.
#
# Architecture: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Attribute-Based Extensions
# Security: Zero-trust with explicit allow-list authorization
# Performance: O(1) ability resolution with memoized permission checks
# Compliance: Multi-jurisdictional data access controls with audit trails
