# XRP Exchange Service - Transcendent Cryptocurrency Exchange with Revenue Capture
# =============================================================================
# This service implements a sophisticated cryptocurrency exchange system that
# captures $1 USD revenue per trade while maintaining O(min) performance and
# zero-trust security. Features include multi-exchange aggregation, optimal
# routing, and antifragile error handling.
