# Dynamic Pricing Engine - Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

The Dynamic Pricing Engine requires:
- Ruby 3.2+ (Rails 8.0 requirement)
- Bundler 2.0+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (for caching)

## Current System Status

Your system is currently using:
- Ruby 2.6.10 (system Ruby)
- This is too old for Rails 8.0

## Step 1: Install Ruby Version Manager

You'll need to install a Ruby version manager first. We recommend **rbenv**:

### Install rbenv (macOS)

```bash
# Install rbenv via Homebrew
brew install rbenv ruby-build

# Add rbenv to your shell
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
# OR for zsh:
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload your shell
source ~/.bash_profile  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Install Ruby 3.2+

```bash
# Install Ruby 3.2.2 (or latest stable)
rbenv install 3.2.2

# Set it as the local version for this project
cd /Users/j.u.s.t.v.i.b.e.z.ofyonderclwdrs/TheFinalMarket/augment/TheFinalMarket
rbenv local 3.2.2

# Verify
ruby --version  # Should show 3.2.2
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install bundler
gem install bundler

# Install project dependencies
bundle install
```

## Step 3: Fix Gemfile Issues (Already Done)

âœ… The Gemfile has been updated to fix the `windows` platform issue.

Changes made:
- Line 22: Changed `platforms: %i[ windows jruby ]` to `platforms: %i[ mingw mswin x64_mingw jruby ]`
- Line 43: Changed `platforms: %i[ mri windows ]` to `platforms: %i[ mri mingw mswin x64_mingw ]`

## Step 4: Run Database Migrations

Once Ruby 3.2+ is installed:

```bash
# Run the migrations
bin/rails db:migrate
```

This will create the following tables:
- `pricing_rules`
- `pricing_rule_conditions`
- `price_changes`
- `competitor_prices`
- `price_experiments`

And add columns to the `products` table:
- `cost_cents`
- `min_price_cents`
- `max_price_cents`
- `auto_pricing_enabled`
- `last_price_update_at`
- `price_optimization_score`

## Step 5: Load Seed Data

```bash
# Option 1: Load just pricing seeds
bin/rails runner "load Rails.root.join('db/seeds/pricing_seeds.rb')"

# Option 2: Load all seeds (if you want to reload everything)
bin/rails db:seed
```

This will create:
- 20+ pricing rules across different products
- Competitor price data for 10 products
- Historical price changes
- 5 price experiments
- Pricing rule conditions

## Step 6: Set Up Scheduled Jobs

### Option A: Using Whenever Gem

1. Add to Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'whenever', require: false
```

2. Install:
```bash
bundle install
```

3. Create schedule file:
```bash
wheneverize .
```

4. Edit `config/schedule.rb`:
```ruby
# config/schedule.rb

# Optimize prices every hour
every 1.hour do
  runner "PricingOptimizationJob.perform_later"
end

# Scrape competitor prices daily at 2 AM
every 1.day, at: '2:00 am' do
  runner "CompetitorPriceScraperJob.perform_later"
end

# Refresh leaderboards every hour (for gamification)
every 1.hour do
  runner "Leaderboard.refresh_all"
end

# Generate daily challenges at midnight (for gamification)
every 1.day, at: '12:00 am' do
  runner "DailyChallenge.generate_for_date(Date.current)"
end
```

5. Update crontab:
```bash
whenever --update-crontab
```

### Option B: Using Sidekiq Cron

1. Add to Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-cron'
```

2. Install:
```bash
bundle install
```

3. Create initializer `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb`:
```ruby
# config/initializers/sidekiq.rb

if Sidekiq.server?
  schedule_file = "config/schedule.yml"
  
  if File.exist?(schedule_file)
    Sidekiq::Cron::Job.load_from_hash YAML.load_file(schedule_file)
  end
end
```

4. Create `config/schedule.yml`:
```yaml
# config/schedule.yml

pricing_optimization:
  cron: "0 * * * *"  # Every hour
  class: "PricingOptimizationJob"
  queue: default

competitor_price_scraping:
  cron: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
  class: "CompetitorPriceScraperJob"
  queue: low_priority

leaderboard_refresh:
  cron: "0 * * * *"  # Every hour
  class: "LeaderboardRefreshJob"
  queue: default

daily_challenge_generation:
  cron: "0 0 * * *"  # Daily at midnight
  class: "DailyChallengeGenerationJob"
  queue: default
```

### Option C: Manual Testing (Development)

For testing, you can run jobs manually:

```bash
# Optimize pricing for all products
bin/rails runner "PricingOptimizationJob.perform_now"

# Scrape competitor prices
bin/rails runner "CompetitorPriceScraperJob.perform_now"

# Optimize a specific product
bin/rails runner "PricingOptimizationJob.perform_now(Product.first.id)"
```

## Step 7: Configure Redis (Optional but Recommended)

Redis is used for caching optimal prices and analytics data.

### Install Redis (macOS)

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install redis

# Start Redis
brew services start redis

# Verify it's running
redis-cli ping  # Should return "PONG"
```

### Configure Rails to use Redis

Already configured in Rails 8.0 with Solid Cache, but you can verify in `config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.cache_store = :solid_cache_store
```

## Step 8: Start the Application

```bash
# Start Rails server
bin/rails server

# Or with specific port
bin/rails server -p 3000
```

## Step 9: Access the Pricing Dashboard

Once the server is running, navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000/seller/pricing
```

You'll need to:
1. Sign in as a seller user
2. Have products in your account

## Step 10: Test the System

### Test Price Recommendations

```bash
bin/rails console
```

```ruby
# Get a product
product = Product.first

# Get price recommendation
service = DynamicPricingService.new(product)
recommendation = service.price_recommendation

# View the recommendation
puts recommendation.inspect

# Apply the recommendation
service = DynamicPricingService.new(product)
optimal_price = service.optimal_price
product.update!(price_cents: optimal_price)
```

### Test Pricing Rules

```ruby
# Create a flash sale rule
product = Product.first
rule = product.pricing_rules.create!(
  user: product.user,
  name: "Weekend Flash Sale",
  rule_type: :time_based,
  status: :active,
  priority: :high,
  config: {
    flash_sale_active: true,
    flash_sale_discount: 30
  }
)

# Apply the rule
rule.apply!

# Check the new price
product.reload
puts "New price: #{product.price_cents}"
```

### Test Competitor Pricing

```ruby
# Add a competitor price
CompetitorPrice.create!(
  competitor_name: "Amazon",
  product_identifier: product.sku,
  price_cents: 9500,
  url: "https://amazon.com/product/#{product.sku}",
  in_stock: true,
  active: true,
  last_checked_at: Time.current
)

# Create competitor-based rule
rule = product.pricing_rules.create!(
  user: product.user,
  name: "Match Amazon",
  rule_type: :competitor_based,
  status: :active,
  priority: :critical,
  config: {
    competitor_strategy: 'undercut',
    undercut_percentage: 5
  }
)

# Apply the rule
rule.apply!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migrations won't run

**Solution:** Ensure you're using Ruby 3.2+ and Bundler 2.0+

```bash
ruby --version  # Should be 3.2+
bundle --version  # Should be 2.0+
```

### Issue: "Table doesn't exist" errors

**Solution:** Run migrations

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

### Issue: No products to test with

**Solution:** Create test products or run the main seeds

```bash
bin/rails db:seed
```

### Issue: Jobs not running

**Solution:** Make sure you have a job processor running

```bash
# For Solid Queue (Rails 8 default)
bin/rails solid_queue:start

# Or in development, jobs run inline by default
```

### Issue: Redis connection errors

**Solution:** Start Redis

```bash
brew services start redis
```
