### 2. Pricing Rule Types

#### Time-Based Pricing
Adjust prices based on time of day, day of week, or specific dates.

**Use Cases:**
- Flash sales (limited time discounts)
- Happy hour pricing (specific hours)
- Weekend specials
- Holiday pricing

**Example Configuration:**
```ruby
{
  flash_sale_active: true,
  flash_sale_discount: 30,
  happy_hours: [14, 15, 16] # 2-4 PM
}
```

#### Inventory-Based Pricing
Automatically adjust prices based on stock levels.

**Use Cases:**
- Clearance sales for low stock
- Premium pricing for limited availability
- Automatic discounts to move inventory

**Example Configuration:**
```ruby
{
  low_stock_threshold: 10,
  clearance_discount: 25
}
```

#### Demand-Based Pricing (Surge Pricing)
Increase prices during high demand, decrease during low demand.

**Use Cases:**
- Surge pricing for trending products
- Discounts for slow-moving items
- Dynamic adjustment based on traffic

**Example Configuration:**
```ruby
{
  high_demand_threshold: 50,
  surge_percentage: 15,
  low_demand_threshold: 5,
  low_demand_discount: 10
}
```

#### Competitor-Based Pricing
Match or beat competitor prices automatically.

**Use Cases:**
- Price matching guarantees
- Undercutting competitors
- Premium positioning

**Strategies:**
- `match_lowest`: Match the lowest competitor price
- `undercut`: Beat competitors by X%
- `match_average`: Match average market price
- `premium`: Stay above market by X%

**Example Configuration:**
```ruby
{
  competitor_strategy: 'undercut',
  undercut_percentage: 5
}
```

#### Seasonal Pricing
Adjust prices based on seasons or months.

**Use Cases:**
- Holiday pricing
- Seasonal product adjustments
- Back-to-school sales

**Example Configuration:**
```ruby
{
  seasonal_adjustments: {
    '11' => 10,  # November: +10%
    '12' => 15,  # December: +15%
    '1' => -20   # January: -20%
  }
}
```

#### Bundle Pricing
Offer discounts for multiple item purchases.

**Use Cases:**
- Buy 2 get 5% off
- Bulk purchase discounts
- Package deals

**Example Configuration:**
```ruby
{
  bundle_discount_tier1: 5,   # 2-4 items
  bundle_discount_tier2: 10,  # 5-9 items
  bundle_discount_tier3: 15   # 10+ items
}
```

#### Volume Pricing
Tiered pricing based on quantity.

**Use Cases:**
- Wholesale pricing
- Bulk discounts
- B2B pricing

**Example Configuration:**
```ruby
{
  volume_tiers: [
    { min: 10, discount: 5 },
    { min: 50, discount: 10 },
    { min: 100, discount: 15 }
  ]
}
```

#### AI-Optimized Dynamic Pricing
Fully automated pricing using machine learning.

**Use Cases:**
- Hands-off price optimization
- Complex multi-factor pricing
- Continuous improvement

### 3. Pricing Rule Conditions

Add conditions to control when rules apply:

**Condition Types:**
- `time_of_day`: Specific hours (0-23)
- `day_of_week`: Days (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)
- `stock_level`: Current inventory
- `view_count`: Product views (24h)
- `sales_velocity`: Sales rate (7d)
- `competitor_price`: Competitor pricing
- `user_segment`: Customer type
- `cart_value`: Shopping cart total
- `product_age`: Days since listing
- `season`: Current season

**Operators:**
- `equals`, `not_equals`
- `greater_than`, `less_than`
- `greater_than_or_equal`, `less_than_or_equal`
- `between`
- `in_list`, `not_in_list`

**Example:**
```ruby
# Only apply flash sale on weekends
PricingRuleCondition.create!(
  pricing_rule: rule,
  condition_type: :day_of_week,
  operator: :in_list,
  value: '0,6' # Sunday and Saturday
)
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Migrations

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

### 2. Seed Initial Data

```bash
# Load pricing seeds
load Rails.root.join('db/seeds/pricing_seeds.rb')
```

### 3. Schedule Background Jobs

Add to `config/schedule.rb` (using whenever gem):

```ruby
# Optimize prices hourly
every 1.hour do
  runner "PricingOptimizationJob.perform_later"
end

# Scrape competitor prices daily
every 1.day, at: '2:00 am' do
  runner "CompetitorPriceScraperJob.perform_later"
end
```

Or use Sidekiq cron:

```ruby
# config/initializers/sidekiq.rb
Sidekiq::Cron::Job.create(
  name: 'Pricing Optimization',
  cron: '0 * * * *', # Every hour
  class: 'PricingOptimizationJob'
)

Sidekiq::Cron::Job.create(
  name: 'Competitor Price Scraping',
  cron: '0 2 * * *', # Daily at 2 AM
  class: 'CompetitorPriceScraperJob'
)
```

### 4. Configure Redis (for analytics)

Ensure Redis is running for real-time analytics caching.

## Best Practices

### For Sellers

1. **Set Price Bounds**: Always set min/max prices to prevent extreme changes
2. **Start Conservative**: Begin with small adjustments (5-10%)
3. **Monitor Results**: Check analytics weekly
4. **Test Gradually**: Use A/B tests before full rollout
5. **Consider Margins**: Ensure minimum 20% profit margin

### For Developers

1. **Cache Aggressively**: Cache optimal prices for 1 hour
2. **Background Processing**: Run optimization jobs asynchronously
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track job execution times
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle scraping failures
5. **Rate Limiting**: Respect competitor site rate limits

---

## Troubleshooting

### Prices Not Updating
- Check if `auto_pricing_enabled` is true
- Verify pricing rules are active
- Check background job queue
- Review min/max price constraints

### Competitor Prices Not Scraping
- Verify API credentials
- Check rate limits
- Review scraper logs
- Ensure product SKUs match

### Low Optimization Score
- Insufficient historical data
- No competitor price data
- Prices already optimal
- Need more active rules
