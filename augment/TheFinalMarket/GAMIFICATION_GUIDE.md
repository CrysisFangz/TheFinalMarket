1. **Balance Rewards**: Ensure rewards are meaningful but not too easy to obtain
2. **Regular Updates**: Add new achievements and challenges regularly
3. **Seasonal Events**: Create special limited-time achievements
4. **User Feedback**: Monitor which achievements are popular
5. **A/B Testing**: Test different reward structures

### For Designers

1. **Visual Feedback**: Ensure all actions have clear visual feedback
2. **Celebration Moments**: Make achievement unlocks feel special
