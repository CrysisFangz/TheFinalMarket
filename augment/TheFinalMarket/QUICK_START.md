## 🎯 Quick Setup (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Ruby 3.2+

```bash
# Install rbenv
brew install rbenv ruby-build

# Add to shell (choose one)
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
# OR
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload shell
source ~/.bash_profile  # or source ~/.zshrc

# Install Ruby 3.2.2
rbenv install 3.2.2

# Set for this project
cd /Users/j.u.s.t.v.i.b.e.z.ofyonderclwdrs/TheFinalMarket/augment/TheFinalMarket
rbenv local 3.2.2

ruby --version  # Should show 3.2.2
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

### Step 3: Run Migrations

```bash
bin/rails db:migrate
```

### Step 4: Load Seed Data

```bash
bin/rails runner "load Rails.root.join('db/seeds/pricing_seeds.rb')"
```

### Step 5: Start Server

```bash
bin/rails server
```

Then visit: **http://localhost:3000/seller/pricing**

rule = product.pricing_rules.create!(
  user: product.user,
  name: "Test Flash Sale",
  rule_type: :time_based,
  status: :active,
  priority: :high,
  config: { flash_sale_active: true, flash_sale_discount: 30 }
)
rule.apply!

# Test competitor pricing
CompetitorPrice.create!(
  competitor_name: "Amazon",
  product_identifier: product.sku,
  price_cents: 9500,
  url: "https://amazon.com/product/#{product.sku}",
  in_stock: true,
  active: true,

## 🚀 Next Steps After Ruby Installation

Once you have Ruby 3.2+ installed:

1. Run the 5 setup steps above
2. Visit the pricing dashboard
3. Review the analytics
4. Create custom pricing rules
5. Enable auto-pricing for products
6. Set up scheduled jobs (optional)

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Start Small**: Enable auto-pricing for 1-2 products first
- **Set Bounds**: Always set min/max prices
- **Monitor**: Check analytics daily for the first week
- **Test Rules**: Test pricing rules in development first
- **A/B Test**: Use experiments before full rollout
